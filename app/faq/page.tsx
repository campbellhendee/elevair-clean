const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How quickly can you get started?",
    answer: "We typically start within 1-2 weeks of our initial call. The audit phase begins immediately, and we'll have your roadmap within 2-3 days."
  },
  {
    question: "What if the system doesn't work for us?",
    answer: "Everything we build is reversible. If you're not happy with the results after 30 days, we'll help you revert to your previous setup and refund 50% of the project fee."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with our existing tools?",
    answer: "Yes, we integrate with your current CRM, email platform, and other tools. We don't replace what's workingâ€”we make it work better."
  },
  {
    question: "How much time does our team need to invest?",
    answer: "Minimal. We need about 2-3 hours total from your team during the audit phase, then 1-2 hours for training. We handle everything else."
  },
  {
    question: "What industries do you work with?",
    answer: "We work with B2B service businesses, SaaS companies, consultants, and agencies. If you sell high-value services and need more qualified leads, we can help."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a long-term contract?",
    answer: "No contracts. The project fee covers everything outlined in your roadmap. The optional retainer is month-to-month and can be canceled anytime."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure success?",
    answer: "We track qualified leads, response times, conversion rates, and ultimately revenue impact. You'll get a monthly report showing exactly what's working."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if we need changes after launch?",
    answer: "The first 4 weeks include unlimited tweaks and optimization. After that, small changes are included in the optional retainer, or we can quote larger modifications separately."
